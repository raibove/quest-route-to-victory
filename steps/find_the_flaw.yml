learningObjectives: 
- Identify which restricted pages are accessible without login and verify the issue by replicating it. 
hints:
- To know what all routes are configured, check the App.js file.  
- Navigate to each route and if you think it should be a restricted route accessible to only authenticated users, message the page name on Snack.
