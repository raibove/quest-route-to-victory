learningObjectives: 
- Identify which restricted pages are accessible without logging in.
hints:
- To see all configured routes, check the App.js file in frontend.
- Try going over each route and tell me which one you think you should restrict to authenticated users only
- Do you think adding a item should be allowed to unauthenticated users?
