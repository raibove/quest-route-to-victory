learningObjectives: 
- Create a PrivateRoute component that will redirect the user to Login Page if the user tries to access restricted pages without authentication.
hints:
- Create a new file called as `PrivateRoute` in components folder.
- You can use `react-router-dom` to handle the logic.
- Make use of currentUser to check if user is logged-in or not & pass it as props to PrivateRoute.
- Refer to the example from documentation to understand how to create a private route https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/example/auth-workflow
